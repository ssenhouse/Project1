For project 1, we decided to create a portfolio investment tool based on some of our inclass projects. However, our professor challenged us to dig deeper and leverage risk parity portfolio theory to create our tool. With that in mind, we created a tool that takes a client's risk tolerance and asset choices to create a portfolio. The tool also uses a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast the future returns of the portfolio. Finally, we created charts to communicate and report our results
