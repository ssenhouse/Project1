For project 1, our team "Fab Five Advisors", decided to create a portfolio investment tool based on some of our in-class projects. However, our professor challenged us to dig deeper and leverage risk parity portfolio theory to create our tool. With that in mind, we created a tool that takes a client's risk tolerance and asset choices to create a portfolio. The tool also uses a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast the future returns of the portfolio. Finally, we created summary statitics, and charts to communicate and report our results

# Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 specifically and assumes that jupyter lab has been installed. In additon, you would need to have the following modules installed:
* pandas
* riskfolio
* yfinance
* pathlib

## Custom modules
These modules we leveraged to provide inputs and simulation results
1. MCSimulation.py - Provided by Columbia FinTech BootCamp
2. clientprofile.py - Developed by Fab Five Advisors

## Installation Guide
### To review Project 1:

* First install the following dependent libraries
```python
pip install riskfolio-lib
pip install yfinance
```

* First initialze the dev environment and the Jupyter lab by typing the following at the command prompt:  

```python
conda activate dev
jupyter lab
```
* Second open the Jupter Notebook titled: **fab_five_porfolio_picker.ipynb** 

* Run all of the code answering questions on risk tolerance and investment horizon

# Resources

Critical to us completing this project were the following websites. We recommend that you leverage these resources. They helped us:
* understand risk parity portfolio theory, and the options within the riskfolio library[https://riskfolio-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html]
* understand how to construct a risk tolerance variable to quantify an investor's appetite for investment risk[https://finmasters.com/risk-profile-test/#gref]
* source market data on investment assets from yahoo finance allowing us to quickly create a universe to choose assets[https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance]

# Results
To illustrate the results of our model, we ran scenerios to understand the extremes of the model. Specifically, if we are to maximize returns based on the client's risk aversion, how do our results in our porfolio change. 

# Next Steps
One of the exciting outcomes of this project is that there is long list of options for further analysis and customization of the report. The following is not an exhaustive list, but will provide ideas on what other steps can be taken with this project.

**Additional questions that surfaced.**
* Universe of investments. For simplicity and to meet our project timeline, we created a static universe comprising of a mixed bag of instruments to include stocks, bonds and etfâ€™s. We did this to ensure not just a variety of companies but asset classes as well. 
* How to best define risk? Specifically, how can we develop a more in depth analysis for creating the investor profile. As we started to use the model to solve for the optimal porfolio, we observed that the model follow a logarithmic estimation for the weights of the optimal portfolio. Therefore, we found it necessary to scale our risk aversion factor to see the extremes of the portfolio recommendations based on our universe. Therefore, both the asset classes and the risk tolerance variable are critical inputs
